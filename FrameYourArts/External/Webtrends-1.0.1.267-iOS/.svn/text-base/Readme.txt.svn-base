This document provides an overview of the Library and the most basic
instructions for using the Webtrends Mobile Application library to send data
from an iPhone application to the Webtrends Data Collection API.  When
application events occur, they can be passed in parameters and sent to the data
collection server for inclusion in Webtrends reporting. 

For complete information about using the Library, see the online documentation
located here:

Components in This Package
--------------------------    

This package contains the following files:

--Webtrends.plist contains the operational settings for the Library.
--Webtrends.mom defines the Managed Object Model used to cache events.
--The Webtrends.framework folder contains the framework and header files.
--The Data Collection Sample folder contains a sample application.


Instrumenting Your Application for Webtrends Data Collection
------------------------------------------------------------
    
The following steps provide an overview of the instrumentation process.

You can implement this library using the following general steps:

	1. Add WebtrendsClientLibrary.plist and WebtrendsClientLibrary.mom to your
		Xcode project. Make sure that "Copy items into destination group's
		folder"	is selected.

	2. Select the WebtrendsClientLibrary.plist file and make these two changes:
		i) Change the wt_dc_dcsid value so it contains your dcsid. The dcsid is
			the	unique ID associated with a Webtrends data source.
		ii) Change the wt_dc_timezone value so it contains your Webtrends data
			source timezone, expressed as a GMT offset in hours.  If you don't
			have a dcsid or you don't know what a data source is, contact your
			Webtrends administrator.

	3. Using the Add > Existing Frameworks > Add Others path: 
		i)Add the Webtrends.framework file to your project. Use the Add >
			Existing Frameworks > Add Others path, which enables you to upgrade
			the	SDK	later if you need to.  
		ii)Add SystemConfiguration.framework, CoreData.framework, and
			CoreLocation.framework.

	4. Add an Import statement to the Webtrends.h header file by adding it
		globally to the .pch file using the following code:
			#import <Webtrends/Webtrends.h>. 
		If you don't have a .pch file, you can add it to each controller or
		other class.

	5. Set the Other Linker Flags to include -all_load and -ObjC.

	6. Modify the application delegate so that it inherits WTAppDelegate instead
		of the default NSObject. This implements basic tracking of application
		launches, stops, and starts.

	7. Implement: 
		
		- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
		
		and call super on it. You should also call super on any methods you
		override from UIApplicationDelegate.       

	8. To customize your event tracking and obtain deeper insight, implement any
		of the explicit methods described in the documentation.


Using the Sample Application
----------------------------

The sample application is included to show you how an application can be
instrumented using the Webtrends Mobile Application Library.  The following
steps provide a way to use the sample application:

	1. Copy the following files into the Data Collection Sample folder:
		Webtrends.mom
		Webtrends.plist

	2. Copy the following folder into the Data Collection Sample folder:
		Webtrends.framework 

	3. Open the Data Collection Sample.xcodeproj in Xcode.

	4. Modify the Webtrends.plist file as follows:
		Change the wt_dc_dcsid value to your dcsid.
		Change the wt_dc_timezone value to your timezone.

	5. Build and run the Sample Application.


Reporting Expectations
----------------------
    
After you implement the Webtrends client library as described in steps 1-7 of
"Instrumenting Your Application for Webtrends Data Collection," you can expect
standard reports such as page views to be populated when you create a basic
profile based on the data source to which you are sending data.  Additional
reporting can be created based on custom parameter values tailored to your
application. 

	
Content View Methods and Webtrends Parameters
---------------------------------------------

Many of the methods associated with the Library ask for one or more values to
be passed to them. These values automatically populate various Webtrends
parameters, which are used to generate the various predefined reports you see
in Webtrends. You can then create your own custom reports using these same
parameters.  

For a list of these parameters, see the documentation.

You do NOT need to create these parameters manually in the iPhone library.
When you implement the methods described in the documentation and pass your
custom values, Webtrends parameters are implemented automatically.


Setting Up Webtrends Reporting
------------------------------

To set up reporting based on this data:

	1. Create a profile for reporting. This profile should use the same data
		source associated with the unique dcsid used to set up data collection.

	2. Services will assist you in creating custom reports based on custom 
		tracking parameters.
